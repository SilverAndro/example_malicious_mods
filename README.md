# (Example) Malicious Jars

## What is this?

This repo contains several jars who's purpose is for testing various Minecraft sandboxes. Their
end goal is to drop the [EICAR test file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EICAR_test_file) on the
users desktop when run, or some similar goal.

## Will this infect my computer?

Nope, these are *example* programs that shouldn't do anything but make your antivirus complain. 
(see page on test file).

## But I have a virus

Not my problem! These don't do anything actually malicious

## Do you accept contributions?

Yep! As long as you own the source, feel free to contribute anything :D

Because this doesnt actually use any modding toolchains, having lots of subprojects to compile doesn't noticeably slow it down

## Forge versions?

I don't know forge and the documentation isnt kind to "how do i assemble a forge mod from scratch"
so ive only provided fabric versions, anyone is welcome to PR forge versions however.
